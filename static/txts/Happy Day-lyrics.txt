Happy Day

Verse 1
The greatest day in history
Death is beaten You have rescued me
Sing it out Jesus is alive
The empty cross the empty grave
Life eternal You have won the day
Shout it out Jesus is alive
He's alive

Chorus
And oh happy day happy day
You washed my sin away
Oh happy day happy day
I'll never be the same
Forever I am changed
(What a glorious glorious day)
(I'll never be the same)

Verse 2
When I stand in that place
Free at last meeting face to face
I am Yours Jesus You are mine
Endless joy perfect peace
Earthly pain finally will cease
Celebrate Jesus is alive
He's alive

Bridge
Oh what a glorious day
What a glorious way
That You have saved me
And oh what a glorious day
What a glorious name
Hey

Ending
What a glorious glorious day
I'll never be the same
