Great Are You Lord

Verse
You give life You are love
You bring light to the darkness
You give hope You restore ev'ry heart that is broken
And great are You Lord

Chorus
It's Your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise
We pour out our praise
It's Your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise to You only

Bridge
And all the earth will shout Your praise
Our hearts will cry these bones will sing
Great are You Lord
(REPEAT)
