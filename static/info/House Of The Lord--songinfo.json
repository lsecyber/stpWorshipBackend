    "Verse 1": "We worship the God who was\nWe worship the God who is\nWe worship the God who evermore will be\nHe opened the prison doors\nHe parted the raging sea\nMy God He holds the victory yeah\n",
    "Chorus": "There\u2019s joy in the house of the Lord\nThere\u2019s joy in the house of the Lord today\nAnd we won\u2019t be quiet\nWe shout out Your praise\nThere\u2019s joy in the house of the Lord\nOur God is surely in this place\nAnd we won\u2019t be quiet\nWe shout out Your praise\n",
    "Interlude": "Oh oh oh\nWe shout out Your praise\n",
    "Verse 2": "We sing to the God who heals\nWe sing to the God who saves\nWe sing to the God who always makes a way\n'Cause He hung up on that cross\nThen He rose up from that grave\nMy God\u2019s still rolling stones away\n",
    "Bridge": "('Cause) We were the beggars\nNow we\u2019re royalty\nWe were the prisoners\nNow we\u2019re running free\nWe are forgiven accepted\nRedeemed by His grace\nLet the house of the Lord sing praise\n",
    "Ending": "We shout out Your praise\nThere is joy in this house\nThere is joy in this house today\nWe shout out Your praise\nWe shout out Your praise\n"
