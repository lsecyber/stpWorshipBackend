    "Verse 1": "The greatest day in history\nDeath is beaten You have rescued me\nSing it out Jesus is alive\nThe empty cross the empty grave\nLife eternal You have won the day\nShout it out Jesus is alive\nHe's alive\n",
    "Chorus": "And oh happy day happy day\nYou washed my sin away\nOh happy day happy day\nI'll never be the same\nForever I am changed\n(What a glorious glorious day)\n(I'll never be the same)\n",
    "Verse 2": "When I stand in that place\nFree at last meeting face to face\nI am Yours Jesus You are mine\nEndless joy perfect peace\nEarthly pain finally will cease\nCelebrate Jesus is alive\nHe's alive\n",
    "Bridge": "Oh what a glorious day\nWhat a glorious way\nThat You have saved me\nAnd oh what a glorious day\nWhat a glorious name\nHey\n",
    "Ending": "What a glorious glorious day\nI'll never be the same\n"
